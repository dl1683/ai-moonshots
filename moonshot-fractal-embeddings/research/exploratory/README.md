# Exploratory Research

This directory contains exploratory theoretical work that has **not been empirically validated**.

These documents are preserved for:
1. **Future research directions** - Ideas worth pursuing
2. **Theoretical completeness** - Extensions of the core theory
3. **Inspiration** - For follow-up moonshots

## Files

| File | Topic | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `HYPERBOLIC_FRACTAL_EMBEDDINGS.md` | Curved geometry for hierarchies | Theory only, no empirical validation |
| `TRAJECTORY_EMBEDDINGS.md` | Meaning as dynamics | Advanced theory, exploratory |
| `HIERARCHICAL_REASONING_HYPOTHESIS.md` | Fractal + LLM reasoning | Future moonshot idea |

## Validation Status

**NONE** of these have been empirically validated. They represent:
- Theoretical extensions
- Future research directions
- Speculative ideas

## For Validated Research

See the parent `research/` directory for validated work:
- `MASTER_DOCUMENT.md` - Complete unified writeup
- `GENERALIZATION_THEORY.md` - Minimax bounds, DAG extensions
- `SAMPLE_COMPLEXITY_THEORY.md` - Sample complexity separation, Fano bounds
- `SCALE_SEPARATED_EMBEDDINGS_THEORY.md` - Scale-separated embedding proofs
